The power conversion circuit is over here on page 8 - https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/2165/LD1117.pdf i.e. "Figure 4 Application circuit (for other fixed output voltages)"

The motor drive circuit is over here - https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-13-dc-motors/breadboard-layout  We built this one twice, once for each motor

There's a Frankenbot-0.1.fzz file, which is a schematic of what was built, along with photos showing the actual build.

And there's a couple of videos to see: https://t.co/9DOaJtEQXo and https://t.co/3I2LFPyVzN
